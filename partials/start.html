      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Welcome! In this game, you will be presented with a tweet, which either was written by Donald Trump himself, or it's something we made up on the spot. The point of the game is to figure out if a tweet is real or fake, and each correct answer grants one point. If you are wrong, however, we will subtract 5 points from your score.</p>

      <p >The fake tweets are generated using a markov chain, where a couple of random words from Trumps existing tweets is extracted and glued together into one beautiful mess. This is why you might recognize some of the fake tweets as real ones, because they are partially real. After each tweet, you are notifyed by Trump if you were correct or not, aswell as examine some statistics for the game overall. Good luck!</p>
